# scriptoresque â€“ a ClojureScript plugin for Gradle

## What is Gradle?

[Gradle][] is a build system written in Java and [Groovy][]. One advantage
of [Gradle][] is, that the build script itself is also a [Groovy][] script.
That means whatever can be done in [Groovy][] can be done in the build
script. This is useful to abstract away common patterns in the build like
repetition or conditional decisions.

On top of that [Gradle][] provides a convenient build system which comes
in form of different plugins. Each plugin defines certain conventions which
(if followed) automasie 95% of the build completely. Still the conventions
are freely configurable to be adapted to different project structures.

## What is scriptoresque?

[scriptoresque][cg] is now a plugin for [Gradle][], which adds
[ClojureScript][clj] support. It allows compilation with automatic namespace
recognition. The plugin is based on the Java plugin and hooks into the standard
configurations and archives.

## Usage

Create a `build.gradle` script in the root directory of your project. *Note
that gradle derives the project name from the name of this directory!*

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven { url 'http://clojars.org/repo' }
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath 'clojuresque:scriptoresque:1.0.0'
        }
    }
    
    apply plugin: 'clojurescript'

## Meta plugin

This is a meta plugin applying the various parts of the clojuresque and
scriptoresque ecosphere.

## Issues

This is **alpha** software! Expect problems! Please report issues in the
bugtracker at [bitbucket][bb]. Or email them to me.

General support is available on the [clojuresque google group][cgg].
